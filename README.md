# Submission Tracker Take-home Challenge

This repository hosts the boilerplate for the Submission Tracker assignment. It includes a Django +
Django REST Framework backend and a Next.js frontend scaffold so candidates can focus on API
design, relational data modelling, and product-focused UI work.

## Challenge Overview

Operations managers need a workspace to review broker-submitted opportunities. Build a lightweight
tool that lets them browse incoming submissions, filter by business context, and inspect full
details per record. Deliver a polished frontend experience backed by clean APIs.

### Goals

- **Backend:** Model the domain, expose list and detail endpoints, and support realistic filtering.
- **Frontend (higher weight):** Craft an intuitive list and detail experience with filters that map
  to query parameters. Focus on UX clarity, organization, and maintainability.

## Data Model

Required entities (already defined in `submissions/models.py`):

- `Broker`: name, contact email
- `Company`: legal name, industry, headquarters city
- `TeamMember`: internal owner for a submission
- `Submission`: links to company, broker, owner with status, priority, and summary
- `Contact`: primary contacts for a submission
- `Document`: references to supporting files
- `Note`: threaded context for collaboration

Seed data (~25 submissions with dozens of related contacts, documents, and notes) is available via
`python manage.py seed_submissions`. Re-run with `--force` to rebuild the dataset.

## API Requirements

- `GET /api/submissions/`
  - Returns paginated submissions with company, broker, owner, counts of related documents/notes,
    and the latest note preview.
  - Supports filters via query params. `status` is wired up; extend filters for `brokerId` and
    `companySearch` (plus optional extras like `createdFrom`, `createdTo`, `hasDocuments`, `hasNotes`).
- `GET /api/submissions/<id>/`
  - Returns the full submission plus related contacts, documents, and notes.
- `GET /api/brokers/`
  - Returns brokers for the frontend dropdown.

Viewsets, serializers, and base filters are in place but intentionally minimal so you can refine
the query behavior and filtering logic.

## Frontend Workspace Overview

The Next.js 16 + React 19 app in `frontend/` is pre-wired for this challenge. Material UI handles
layout, axios powers HTTP requests, and `@tanstack/react-query` is ready for data fetching. The list
and detail routes under `/submissions` are scaffolded so you can focus on API consumption and UX
polish.

### What is pre-built?

- Global providers supply Material UI theming and a shared React Query client.
- `/submissions` hosts the list view with filter inputs and hints about required query params.
- `/submissions/[id]` hosts the detail shell and links back to the list.
- Custom hooks in `lib/hooks` define how to fetch submissions and brokers. Each hook is disabled by
  default (`enabled: false`) so no network requests fire until you enable them.

### What you need to implement

- Wire the filter state to query parameters and React Query `queryFn`s.
- Render table/card layouts for the submission list along with loading, empty, and error states.
- Build the detail page sections for summary data, contacts, documents, and notes.
- Enable the queries and handle pagination or other UX you want to highlight.

## Project Structure

- `backend/`: Django project with REST API, seed command, and submission models.
- `frontend/`: Next.js app described above.
- `INTERVIEWER_NOTES.md`: Context for reviewers/interviewers.

## Environment Variables

- Frontend requests default to `http://localhost:8000/api`. Override this by creating
  `frontend/.env.local` and setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`.

## Getting Started

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py seed_submissions  # optional but recommended
# add --force to rebuild the generated sample data
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local  # create if you want a custom API base
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL defaults to http://localhost:8000/api
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/submissions` to start building.

## Development Workflow

1. Start the Django server on port 8000 (`python manage.py runserver`).
2. Start the Next.js dev server on port 3000 (`npm run dev`).
3. Iterate on backend filters, serializers, and viewsets, then refresh the frontend to see updated
   data.
4. When ready, add README notes summarizing your approach, tradeoffs, and any stretch goals.

## Submission Instructions

- Provide a short README update summarizing approach, tradeoffs, and how to run the solution.
- Record and share a brief screen capture (max 2 minutes) demonstrating the frontend working end-to-end with the backend.
- Call out any stretch goals implemented.
- Automated tests are optional, but including targeted backend or frontend tests is a strong signal.

## Evaluation Rubric

- **Frontend (45%)** – UX clarity, filter UX tied to query params, state/data management, handling
  of loading/empty/error cases, and overall polish.
- **Backend (30%)** – API design, serialization choices, filtering implementation, and attention to
  relational data handling.
- **Code Quality (15%)** – Structure, naming, documentation/readability, testing where it adds
  value.
- **Product Thinking (10%)** – Workflow clarity, assumptions noted, and thoughtful UX details.

## Optional Bonus

Authentication, deployment, or extra tooling are not required but welcome if scope allows.

## Submission Summary

### Approach
- **Backend:** Extended `SubmissionFilterSet` to support `brokerId`, `companySearch`, and advanced filters. Optimized the `SubmissionViewSet` with `select_related` and `prefetch_related` to minimize N+1 queries.
- **Frontend:**
  - Implemented a robust data fetching layer using `@tanstack/react-query` with debounced search and URL-synchronized state.
  - Built a responsive `SubmissionTable` with interactive rows, status/priority chips, and tooltips for note previews.
  - Developed a comprehensive detail page with dedicated sections for Contacts, Documents, and a threaded Notes timeline with author avatars and relative timestamps.
  - Implemented full pagination and state management for loading, empty, and error cases.

### Tradeoffs
- **Styling:** Chose to use MUI's `sx` prop for rapid development of specific component styles while maintaining consistency with the global theme.
- **State Management:** Prioritized URL-based state for filters to ensure that the view state is shareable and persists across refreshes, which adds a bit more complexity in syncing React state with URL parameters but significantly improves UX.
- **Backend Complexity:** Used `django-filter` for declarative filtering, which is powerful but requires explicit parameter naming in the `FilterSet` to match the frontend's camelCase convention.

### Stretch Goals Implemented
- **Advanced Filtering:** Added date range (`createdFrom`, `createdTo`) and boolean presence filters (`hasDocuments`, `hasNotes`) to both backend and frontend.
- **Performance Optimization:** Implemented eager loading on the backend to ensure the detail page fetches all related data in a single request (plus reverse relations prefetches).
- **UX Polish:** Added skeleton loaders for both the list and detail pages to provide a smooth perceived performance during data transitions.
- **Author Avatars:** Implemented deterministic color-coded avatars in the notes section based on author names.
